# Using arcpy to read and write geometries.

## Reading

### Points
Already seen

### Lines
Can do

### Polygons

Point worth noting:

In arcpy, when you retrieve the geometry of a feature, it's represented as a sequence of points that describe the shape of the feature. For example, a rectangle might be represented by five points: the first and last points are the same to close the polygon. So a qaudrilateral feature would have five vertices.
